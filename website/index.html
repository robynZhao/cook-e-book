          <h3><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> What is cook-eBook?</h3>
          <p>cook-eBook is a single place for storing and collecting any and all information needed to carry out a recipe. It allows for a high level of recipe customization, from cooking directions, ingredients, cooking time and even user-uploaded photos. Additionally, cook-eBook will give users the ability to both mark recipes as favourites, as well tag recipes with pre-suggested or custom labels. These labels can then be used at a later time to easily sort through and filter recipes. Additionally, for those who enjoy using existing recipes as a starting point for new ideas, cook-eBook provides an easy solution by providing the ability to duplicate and edit an existing recipe.</p>

          <h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Who is cook-eBook for?</h3>
          <p>cook-eBook is designed primarily for individuals looking for one place to store their recipes, whether it be for simple recipe sharing or just to have an easy way to browse many recipes. While cook-eBook’s simple design will allow for users with varying skill levels to learn and use the app with ease, the specific target audience is primarily adults, as they are more likely to fully utilize a recipe collection app. Additionally, cook-eBook also appeals to younger adults, who could use it while learning to cook, and over time would naturally expand their collection of recipes. cook-eBook could also be attractive to parents who could potentially use it to both store recipes, and share them with family members to cook something.</p>

              <h3><i class="fas fa-money-bill"></i> Why is cook-eBook valuable?</h3>
              <p>cook-eBook is a significant improvement over more traditional methods of recipe storage (such as handwritten binders or boxes of recipes). cook-eBook includes modern features such as searching and filtering to make finding recipes much quicker. An additional benefit to a digital collection of recipes is the reliability that comes along with it. With a traditional recipe storage method, there is a very real possibility of misplacing a recipe. With cook-eBook, the only way to misplace a recipe would be if it was manually deleted. cook-eBook also improves on the aspect of shareability, as people who have never seen or made this recipe before can view an image of the result to help them with choosing or following a recipe. Accessibility is also a key feature to cook-eBook which is why it was designed with a feature that will read the recipe out loud to the user. This could benefit either individuals who may not be able to read the recipe traditionally or be a convenience to a typical user while making a recipe.</p>
    
              <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> How will the success be measured</h3>
              <p>cook-eBook’s success will be measured based on a number of goals. The first goal would be for users to find cook-eBook more efficient than a traditional recipe collection method when comparing the two. The second goal would be for users to find the recipe sharing functionality easy and simple. Lastly, the overall goal is for the app to be so intuitive that the simplicity and ease of use rivals simply writing a recipe on a piece of paper.</p>

      <h2>Postmortem</h2>

      <h3>What went right in the development process?</h3>
      <p>
        The development process was successful in that the team was able to efficiently work together and complete tasks.
        There was good communication and engagement throughout the team on features, merge requests, and errors. 
        Each member of the team contributed in a meaningful way and everyone was able to pull their weight and own a piece of the final product.
      </p>

      <h3>What went wrong in the development process?</h3>
      <p>
        Some areas that could have been improved upon in the development process are merge request size, as well as time management.
        Often our merge requests got very large, and as a result it became difficult to fully grasp the scope of a single merge request.
        This led to both dead code being merged, as well as code with errors in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, time management also became a large obstacle in our development process.
        Due to the entire team being in multiple other classes, the development work often got pushed until the last minute (especially in the 2nd iteration).
        This led to frantic development, which caused its own issues such as rushed merge requests, dead code, and broken tests.
      </p>

      <h3>What took the most time?</h3>
      <p>
        The database ended up taking really long time (possibly more than expected).
        The bulk of the database work was done in iteration two, and it ended up taking many many hours.
        By the time iteration 3 came around, while the database appeared to be functioning normally, there was still bugs and missing functionality which also ended up taking lots of development time.
        In hindsight, allocating more time (or knowing what to expect) would help reduce the stress caused.
      </p>

      <h3>How did the project change?</h3>
      <p>
        The core project idea itself didn't change. We were able to fairly accurately estimate the amount of work we were capable of achieving.
        We were able to implement recipe operations such as add/edit/duplicate/delete.
        We were able to associate user tags to recipes, and also added organizational tools such as filtering on the tags, on favourite recipes, and searching.
      </p>
      <p>
        One feature that didn't make it in the timeline was the ability for a user to upload an image from their device to use it in the app.
        In the future this would be a really valuable feature to add to the app, however it had to be removed due to time constraints.
