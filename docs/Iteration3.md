# Iteration 3

## This Iteration
This iteration we were able to complete all of our features except for one. The only feature we were not able to complete was uploading photos of your recipe. This will be in our future milestone.

### Features
Finished:

Duplicating Recipes
Share Recipes

Started but not Finished:
- Recipe Photos


### User Stories
Finished:
Search for Recipe
Share Recipe by Email
Read Recipe Details out
Mark Recipe as Favourite
View an image of my Recipe

Started but not Finished:
- Add recipe photo

Note for the Marker:
- If you run the acceptance tests multiple times you may have issues because all of the recipes will have been deleted :(
- To fix this issue, just uninstall the app (on the emulator, long press and drag to the top where it says uninstall)
- This will re-initialze the database and then you can run the test again
- For the acceptance tests... turn on your volume.
